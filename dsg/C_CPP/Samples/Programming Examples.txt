ACSC Library samples directory contents:
----------------------------------------

RECIPROCATED  

	The two samples execute a reciprocated point-to-point motion and
	read a motor feedback position. First sample downloads to the
	controller’s program buffer with help of the ACSC functions the
	ACSPL+ program, which performs the described above actions.
	Second sample uses the ACSC functions to execute a motion.
	
	Both of the samples are written as Win32 console apllications.

TERMINAL 
    
	The simple communication terminal, that allows to communicate
	with the SPiiPlus controller via any communication channel as
	serial link (RS-232), Ethernet network, PCI bus and also with 
	the simulator.

	The sample uses the MFC library classes.

SPiiPlus C Library Demo

	Demonstrates how to open communication with a controller, enable motors,
	execute PTP/Jog motion of specified axis with relative coordinate etc.

Measurements Demo
	
	Simple measurement application

Notes:

	The projects of these samples include the reference to the ACSC
	Library files ASCS.H and ACSCL_x86.LIB / ACSC_x64.LIB. These files
	come with the SPiiPlus Tools installation package and place as default
	in the "ACSC\C_CPP\Samples" Library directory: 
	"C:\Program Files (x86)\ACS Motion Control\SPiiPlus ADK Suite v2.70\ACSC".
	The ACSC Library file ACSCL_x86.DLL is stored in the Windows system directory: 
	"\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32" directory on x86 operating systems or
	"\WINDOWS\SYSWOW64" directory on x64 operating systems.
	The ACSC Library file ACSCL_x64.DLL is stored in the Windows system directory: 
	"\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32" directory on x64 operating systems.
